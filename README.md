# Ransomware Risk Assessment & Control Effectiveness Analysis

This repository contains a governance-focused risk assessment examining ransomware threats and the effectiveness of intrusion detection controls in financial network environments.

## Scope
- Ransomware threat analysis
- Behavioral intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- Security control effectiveness evaluation
- Risk and compliance alignment

## Framework Alignment
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- ISO/IEC 27001
- Risk-based security monitoring principles

## Key Focus Areas
- Limitations of signature-based IDS from a risk perspective
- Behavioral indicators of ransomware activity
- Detection accuracy, false positives, and residual risk
- Governance recommendations to strengthen security monitoring controls

## Outcome
The project provides risk-informed recommendations to improve ransomware detection governance, reduce false positives, and enhance compliance posture in regulated environments.

This work demonstrates applied Security GRC skills, including risk assessment, control evaluation, and documentation for audit and management review.
